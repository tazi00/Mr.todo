## Project Phases

### 2. Backend Phase (Node.js with File Data Storage)

In the backend phase, the goal is to set up a robust Node.js server using Express, implement user authentication and authorization, and handle CRUD operations for todos and comments.

#### Tasks

1. **Node.js and Express Setup:**

   - Set up a new Node.js project using the Express framework.
   - Install necessary dependencies for Express.

2. **User Authentication and Authorization:**

   - Implement user registration functionality.
   - Develop a secure user login mechanism.
   - Integrate JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.
   - Design and implement user authorization to control access to specific routes.

3. **User Routes and Profile:**

   - Create routes for user registration, login, and profile.
   - Implement endpoints for updating user information.

4. **Todo and Comment Functionality:**

   - Design routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting todos.
   - Implement similar routes for comments on todos.

5. **Sorting, Filtering, and Searching:**

   - Integrate functionality to sort todos based on different criteria.
   - Implement filtering options for todos.
   - Add a search feature to find todos quickly.

6. **Recycle Bin Feature:**

   - Develop a recycle bin for deleted todos.
   - Allow users to restore todos from the recycle bin.
   - Implement permanent deletion of todos from the recycle bin.

7. **Liking and Disliking Todos:**

   - Create routes for users to like and dislike todos.
   - Implement logic to prevent users from editing or deleting others' todos.

8. **Data Storage Using JSON Files:**
   - Store initial data in JSON files (users.json, comments.json, todos.json, like.json).
   - Set up functions to read and write data to these JSON files.

#### Deliverables

- A fully functional backend server with API routes for user authentication, todos, comments, and additional features.
- JSON files containing initial data for users, todos, comments, and likes.
- Comprehensive testing of backend functionality.
